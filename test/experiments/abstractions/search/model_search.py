        - We're doing the same thing we did for searching through datasets. 
        - Except this time we're doing it for machine learning models
        
        ## Here's the process we'll have
        1. Create a model
        2. Save it to given metadata inside of redis
        3. Find all various metadata inside of redis using incomplete information
        4. Get the dataset_ids by subtype match
        5. Get datasets by_ids (resemble putting datasets by)
        6. Add datasets into a multidata container
        7. Backtest through the multiple datasets
