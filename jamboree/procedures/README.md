# Procedures

Procedures are abstracts that we use to call things in consistent ways. The core example is a model procedure. Multiple different models are called in multiple different ways yet they can look extremely consistent on the surface. For example, calling a `fit` and `partial_fit` can look the same for all major machine learning libraries. 

Let's compare using sklearn and pytorch for a basic fit example.
